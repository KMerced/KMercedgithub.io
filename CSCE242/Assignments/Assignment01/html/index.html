        <h2>Malware, What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Definition: Malware is malicious software that is intended to cause harm to a computer or system.</p>
            <p>People create malware for various reasons. Some do it for fun or to show off their skills, others do it for activism (otherwise known as hackvitism), but the most common reason is for financial gain. Today, malware creators mostly target enterprises and government entities, knowing that they could make lots of money from compromising their systems. However, that doesn't mean the average person isn't targeted either, especially as infostealers are becoming more popular to steal login credentials from people.</p>
            <p>Malware is also spread in various ways. By far the most common way people get infected is by opening unassuming attatchments or by executing an unassuming program. There are other ways people can get infected though, such as by clicking on malicious ads (otherwise known as malvertising) and plugging in random flash drives to their computer. People also get infected by blitzing through an installer, not paying attention to exactly what is being installed.</p>

        <h2>Common Misonceptions About Malware</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Viruses and Malware are the same thing: This is incorrect. Viruses are merely a specific type of malware, however the terms "virus" and "malware" are used interchangably by many.</li>
            <li>Only Windows gets malware, Mac and Linux don't: This is incorrect. Malware absolutely exists for Mac and Linux, there is just far less of it due to less people using them. This is called "security by obscurity."</li>
            <li>Phones can't get malware: This is incorrect. Phones running IOS and Android can absolutely get malware, however this mostly happens if you install apps from outside the central appstore.</li>
            <li>An antivirus is all you need to protect yourself: This is incorrect. While an antivirus solution is suitable for most cases, if there is a "zero-day" malware sample going around, your antivirus will do little against it.</li>
        </ol>
